# Functional Job overview

This purpose of this system is to run a company from a single person to about 100 employees.

Running a company can be split by specific job functions:
- First of all the company has to be promoted so people know it exists, and the products or services it is selling. That is done by the [marketing and sales functions](end_user/marketing_sales.md).
- When the company is known by its target audience, there should be a possibility to order its products or services either by an E-commerce site, social media, email or telephone. Incoming orders are handled by the [Sales order entry function](end_user/sales_order_entry.md)
- When physical product orders do come in they need to be packed and shipped by the [warehouse or inventory management function](end_user/inventory_management.md)
- In order to make sure financial records are recorded when they happen in the operational functions then [accounting](end_user/accounting.md) will automatically generate invoices and payments from the incoming order and will be posted into the ledger.

### In short, how to process an incoming sales order?
1. Approve on the sales order list.
2. Pack and confirm on the outgoing shipment list.

### Result
    full record  of the product -> order -> shipment -> invoice/payment -> accounting ledger
